      The peony or paeony (/ˈpiːəni/)[2][3] is a flowering plant in the genus Paeonia (/piːˈoʊniə/),<br>
      [4] the only genus in the family Paeoniaceae (/piːˌoʊniˈeɪsi.iː/). <br>
      Peonies are native to Asia, Europe, and Western North America. <br>
      Scientists differ on the number of species that can be distinguished, <br>
      ranging from 25 to 40,[5][6] although the current consensus describes 33 known species.<br>
      [7] The relationships between the species need to be further clarified.[8]<br>

      Most are herbaceous perennial plants 0.25–1 metre (1–3 ft) tall, <br>
      but some are woody shrubs 0.25–3.5 metres (1–11 ft) tall. <br>
      They have compound, deeply lobed leaves and large, <br>
      often fragrant flowers, in colors ranging from purple and pink to red, white or yellow, <br>
      in late spring and early summer. <br>
      The flowers have a short blooming season, usually only 7–10 days.<br>

      Peonies are popular garden plants in temperate regions. <br>
      Herbaceous peonies are also sold as cut flowers on a large scale, <br>
      although generally only available in late spring and early summer.[9]<br>

    <aside>
      All Paeoniaceae are herbaceous perennials or deciduous shrubs, <br>
      with thick storage roots and thin roots for gathering water and minerals. <br>
      Some species are caespitose (tufted), <br>
      because the crown produces adventitious buds, <br>
      while others have stolons. <br>
      They have rather large compound leaves without glands and stipules, <br>
      and with anomocytic stomata. <br>
      In the woody species the new growth emerges from scaly buds on the previous flush or from the crown of the rootstock. <br>
      The large bisexual flowers are mostly single at the end of the stem. In P. emodi, P. lactiflora, <br>
      P. veitchii and many of the cultivars these contributed to, <br>
      few additional flowers develop in the axils of the leaves. <br>
      Flowers close at night or when the sky is overcast. <br>
      Each flower is subtended by a number of bracts, <br>
      that may form a sort of involucre, <br>
      has 3-7 tough free sepals and mostly 5–8, <br>
      but occasionally up to 13 free petals. <br>
      These categories however are intergrading, <br>
      making it difficult to assign some of them, <br>
      and the number of these parts may vary. <br>
      Within are numerous (50–160) free stamens, <br>
      with anthers fixed at their base to the filaments, and are sagittate in shape, <br>
      open with longitudinal slits at the outer side and free pollen grains which have three slits or pores and consist of two cells. <br>
      Within the circle of stamens is a more or less prominent, lobed disc, which is presumed not to excrete nectar.<br>
       Within the disk is a varying number (1-15) of separate carpels, which have a very short style and a decurrent stigma. <br>
       Each of these develops into a dry fruit (which is called a follicle), <br>
       which opens with a lengthwise suture and each of which contains one or a few large fleshy seeds. <br>
      The annual growth is predetermined: if the growing tip of a shoot is removed, <br>
      no new buds will develop that season.[9][10][11]
